Generate detailed, interactive study material for the following chapter. Each chapter should include:
1. A **chapter summary** introducing the key concepts.
2. A **section for each topic** with:
   - **Subheadings** for clarity.
   - Concise **explanations** of the concepts.
   - **Code snippets** or examples (if applicable).
   - **Visuals or diagrams** with real image URLs.
   - Real-world applications or clinical correlations (if relevant).
3. End each chapter with a **quick revision section** summarizing the key points in a bullet list.

Please ensure that the content is in **HTML format**, but **without** including the \`<!DOCTYPE html>\`, \`<html>\`, \`<head>\`, or \`<body>\` tags. Below is the chapter information (note that this is **clean JSON format** without extra characters or placeholders):
